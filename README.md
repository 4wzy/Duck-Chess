# Duck-Chess
CS50x final project

Basic rules:
Players make a standard chess move, followed by moving the duck to an empty square on the board.
The duck always moves.
The duck blocks the square where it's placed, making it impossible for other pieces to move to or through it.
Knights can jump over the duck.
There are no checks or checkmatesâ€”players capture the enemy king to win.
Kings can move to attacked squares. They can also castle through attacked squares.
